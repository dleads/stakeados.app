## Templates

The `templates/` directory contains standard templates for creating new specifications:

- `requirements-template.md` - Template for requirements documents
- `design-template.md` - Template for design documents  
- `tasks-template.md` - Template for implementation task lists

## How to Use This Organization

### For Developers
1. **Starting new work**: Check `active/` for ready-to-implement specs
2. **Understanding what's done**: Review `completed/` specs for context
3. **Planning future work**: Look at `phase-2/` for upcoming features

### For Project Management
1. **Tracking progress**: Monitor movement between directories
2. **Prioritizing work**: Focus on `active/` specs first
3. **Planning releases**: Use `phase-2/` for roadmap planning

### Creating New Specifications
1. Copy templates from `templates/` directory
2. Create new directory in appropriate status folder
3. Follow the spec workflow: Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Tasks
4. Move between directories as implementation progresses

## Specification Lifecycle

```
New Idea â†’ active/ â†’ [Implementation] â†’ completed/
              â†“
         [If future] â†’ phase-2/
```

### Status Transitions
- **New specs** start in `active/` if ready for immediate work
- **Future specs** go directly to `phase-2/` if not current priority
- **Completed specs** move to `completed/` when all tasks are done
- **Specs can move back** to `active/` if changes are needed

## Maintenance

This organization should be maintained by:
1. Moving specs between directories as status changes
2. Updating task completion status regularly
3. Archiving truly obsolete specs to a separate archive directory
4. Keeping this README updated with current status

## Legacy Documentation

Previous documentation and specs have been consolidated and archived. See:
- `docs/current-state/legacy-documentation-index.md` for archived content
- `archive/` directory for historical files (when created)
